Having read the criticisms made by my colleagues, I decided to focus more questions than I had previously elaborated in order to be able to elaborate better on the subject. So now, I have focused the research on the last three years according to the list of: Top Female Artist, 2016, 2017 and 2018. In addition, the questions to be answered will be: Who is the most listened to woman or group of women each year? Does any woman repeat being the most listened to artist? Has the number of women residing in that Top music list increased? What do the 3 most listened to songs of the last 3 years have in common and what is the difference between them?
