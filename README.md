# Woman In Music
*The most listened to women in recent years.*

Which women have been the most listened to on Spotify in recent years? What do they all have in common? Are there many? Which are the most predominant styles among women? Will they vary a lot during these 5 years?

Every year Spotify is dedicated to making a list of the most listened to songs of the most listened to artists of that year. Thanks to this we can run a study of what characteristics they share and divide these most listened to artists, as well as whether it is maintained over the years, what trend was worn among women during that year, and if the most listened to positions are disputed among the same over the years.  

Among the common things we can find is that the most listened to of each of the last three years, 2018: *Want to* by Dua Lip, 2017: *Swish Swish* by Katy Perry and 2016 *Good for you*, by Selene Gomez are 0.691, 0.705 and 0.668 of energy, which would represent that they are songs that tend to be energetic. Also that by chance the songs of 2016 and 17 are both in F minor with respect to music.  Something that is common also in the 3 lists mentioned is for example, that most of these songs that are the "most listened or relevant of each artist" are songs that surpass the 0.5 of danceability. 

When talking about genres, we can catch the singer with the most famous song according to each year's spotify and see which genre she belongs to: Selena Gomez with her album *Revival* is pop, Katy Perry with *Witness* is pop/electronic and finally, Ariana Grande with *Sweetener* that mixes several current styles. 

Regarding exaggerated values, there has not yet been any to highlight or draw attention directly, however, there are some exceptions to what I said before that make if you take the average of some values from the data, yield to one side or the other. 

Women are currently having power in the music industry and are evolving in many ways, so I think it's a good topic to discuss and investigate.
